AJAX Page Loader will load posts, pages, etc. without reloading entire page.  This was my first plugin and is still a little quirky.  There is problems working on some themes.  I am working a little at a time on this but if anyone wants to contribute, feel free.

== Change Log ==

Version 1.0 - First release. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `vvrc-page-loader` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
